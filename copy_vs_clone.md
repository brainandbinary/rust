In Rust, both `Copy` and `Clone` are traits used for duplicating values, but they serve different purposes and have different implications:

### Copy

- **Trait Definition**: The `Copy` trait signifies that a type's values can be duplicated simply by copying bits. It's a marker trait, meaning it has no methods to implement.
- **Implicit Semantics**: When a type implements `Copy`, its values are duplicated implicitly by the compiler. This means that when you assign a `Copy` type to another variable or pass it to a function, the value is copied rather than moved.
- **Requirements**: Types that implement `Copy` must have a simple and efficient bitwise copy. This generally applies to types like scalars (integers, floats), tuples of `Copy` types, and arrays of `Copy` types.
- **Usage Example**:
  ```rust
  let x = 5;
  let y = x; // x is still usable because i32 implements Copy
  ```

### Clone

- **Trait Definition**: The `Clone` trait is for types that can explicitly create a deep copy of their values. It includes a method, `clone`, which you must implement.
- **Explicit Semantics**: Cloning is explicit and must be called with the `.clone()` method. This allows for more complex and potentially expensive operations than a simple bitwise copy.
- **Requirements**: Any type can implement `Clone`, even if it requires heap allocation or other resource management.
- **Usage Example**:
  ```rust
  #[derive(Clone)]
  struct MyStruct {
      data: Vec<i32>,
  }

  let a = MyStruct { data: vec![1, 2, 3] };
  let b = a.clone(); // `a` is still usable, and `b` is a deep copy of `a`
  ```

### Key Differences

1. **Implicit vs. Explicit**:
   - `Copy` is implicit and happens automatically.
   - `Clone` is explicit and requires calling `.clone()`.

2. **Cost**:
   - `Copy` is usually very cheap as it involves a simple bitwise copy.
   - `Clone` can be more expensive because it may involve deep copying of data, such as allocating new heap memory.

3. **Restrictions**:
   - Only types that can be safely duplicated with a simple bitwise copy can implement `Copy`.
   - Any type can implement `Clone`, including those that manage heap memory or other resources.

4. **Ownership Semantics**:
   - For `Copy` types, both the original and the copied value can be used independently after the copy.
   - For `Clone` types, the clone method must be called to explicitly duplicate the value, and the original can still be used.

In summary, use `Copy` for simple types where bitwise copying is sufficient and cheap, and use `Clone` for types that require a more complex duplication process.
