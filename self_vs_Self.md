In Rust, **static functions (or associated functions)** in an `impl` block are accessed via `Self` instead of `&self` because they do not operate on an instance of the struct. Instead, they belong to the type itself.

### **Key Differences:**
| Function Type | How It’s Called | Access to Instance (`self`) | Purpose |
|--------------|----------------|-----------------------------|---------|
| **Instance Method (`fn method(&self)`)** | `my_struct.method()` | ✅ Yes, has access to instance fields | Used when modifying or reading instance data |
| **Static Method (`fn method()`)** | `Struct::method()` or `Self::method()` | ❌ No, does not require an instance | Used for utility functions, constructors, etc. |

---

### **Example:**
```rust
struct MyStruct {
    value: i32,
}

impl MyStruct {
    // Instance method (needs `self`)
    fn instance_method(&self) {
        println!("Instance method: value = {}", self.value);
    }

    // Static method (doesn't use `self`)
    fn static_method() {
        println!("Static method called!");
    }
}

fn main() {
    let obj = MyStruct { value: 10 };
    
    obj.instance_method();  // ✅ Calls instance method (needs an instance)
    
    MyStruct::static_method(); // ✅ Calls static method (no instance needed)
}
```

### **Why Use `Self` in Static Methods?**
In Rust, `Self` refers to the struct type within an `impl` block. This is useful because:
1. **It avoids repeating the struct name**:
   ```rust
   impl MyStruct {
       fn create() -> Self {  // Instead of MyStruct
           Self { value: 42 }
       }
   }
   ```
2. **It allows generic and flexible implementations**:
   ```rust
   impl<T> SomeTrait for SomeStruct<T> {
       fn new() -> Self {  // Works for any `T`
           Self { /* fields */ }
       }
   }
   ```

### **Why Not `&self` for Static Methods?**
- `&self` requires an **instance**, but static methods **do not operate on an instance**.
- Static methods exist at the **type level**, not the **instance level**.
